=== Docker QR Decode ===

Simple microservice that takes an image and returns the decoded information.
Supports image formats and pdfs. PDFs need to have the .pdf extension

The server is implemented with NodeJS and Express.
The heavy lifting is performed by linux processes: imagemagick, zbar and poppler-utils
The image is based on node:16-alpine

When built the image is 278MB, when compressed: 91MB

Example consumer:
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" -F "data=@test/1.png" http://localhost:3000/qrdecode

Example output:
{"1.png":"Hello world!"}


To build the docker image:
sudo docker build . -t qrdecode 

To run the docker image:
sudo docker run -p 3000:3000 qrdecode

To save the docker image:
docker save qrdecode -o qrdecode

To zip the docker image for shipping:
gzip -9 qrdecode
